This repo is meant to be a joke.

The main idea is to create a useless .py file and an AI agent that will update the .py file autonomously,
commit the changes and push them to the public repo. The goal is to have a green GH and to trick unexperienced
people to believe that I code everyday.

Do the same if you will.
